# Data-Driven Occupant Modeling

Data-Driven Occupant Modeling is an open-source, BSD-licensed development effort within the EBC Annex 79 - Subtask 2. The goal is to foster an open collaboration platform for data and software tools.

Within the repository the folders contains:

data : 1) examples of datasets for occupant presence and actions including associated scripts; 2) pointers to archived datasets available on relevant platforms for archival storage. 

src : 1) scripts for cleaning, processing and visualising occupant presence and action data; 2) scripts for construction of data-driven occupant models
