# Smart* Data Set for Sustainability

Sean Barker, Aditya Mishra, David Irwin, Emmanuel Cecchet, Prashant Shenoy, and Jeannie Albrecht

The goal of the Smart* project is to optimize home energy consumption. Available here is a wide variety of data collected from three real homes, including electrical (usage and generation), environmental (e.g., temperature and humidity), and operational (e.g., wall switch events). Also available is minute-level electricity usage data from 400+ anonymous homes. Please see the Smart* home page for general information about the project, or the Smart* Tools download page for software that was used in the collection of this data.
