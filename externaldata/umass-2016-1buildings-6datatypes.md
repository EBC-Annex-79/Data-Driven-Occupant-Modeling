# Smart* Data Set for Sustainability

Luis M. Candanedo, and VÃ©ronique Feldheim

The accuracy of the prediction of occupancy in an office room using data from light, temperature, humidity and CO2 sensors has been evaluated with different statistical classification models using the open source program R. Three data sets were used in this work, one for training, and two for testing the models considering the office door opened and closed during occupancy.
