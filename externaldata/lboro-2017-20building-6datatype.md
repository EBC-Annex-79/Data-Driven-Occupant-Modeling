The REFIT project (www.refitsmarthomes.org) carried out a study from 2013 to 2015 in which 20 UK homes were upgraded to Smart Homes through the installation of devices including Smart Meters, programmable thermostats, programmable radiator valves, motion sensors, door sensors and window sensors.

The REFIT Smart Home dataset is one of the datasets made publically available by the project. This dataset includes:
- Building survey data for the 20 homes.
- Sensor measurements made before the Smart Home equipment was installed.
- Sensor measurements made after the Smart Home equipment was installed.
- Climate data recorded at a nearby weather station
